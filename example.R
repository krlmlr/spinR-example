#' #Introduction
#' 
#' I love LaTeX. But sometimes it's just too verbose:
#' 
#' - To add an enumeration, I have to type `\begin{enumerate}`,
#'   `\end{enumerate}`, *and* an additional `\item` for each item
#' - Emphasis, teletype formatting, ... -- all doable, but just a bit too
#'   cumbersome for everyday use
#'
#' Of course there are nice editors with autocompletion and whatnot. But,
#' for simple things, indeed I do prefer Markdown.  Plus, RStudio is not yet
#' a full-fledged LaTeX editor.
#' 
#' On the other hand, formulae are really nice in LaTeX: $2 \cdot 3 = 4$,
#' $\sum_{i=1}^k m_i$, stuff like that.  Cross-references, citations, ...
#' To sum up, I want both.
#' 
#' Also, when doing a statistical analysis, I'm not going to ever copy-paste
#' a number or a figure.  I want everything to be computed by my R script
#' and neatly knitted with `knitr`:  ${2 \cdot 3 =
#- inline=T
2 * 3
#' }$, and this can be even checked:
stopifnot(2 * 3 == 4)
#' However, I don't want to *depend* on it: A simple `Rscript example.R` should
#' run the code, too.  That's where `spin()` comes to play: It will interpret
#' `roxygen`-style comments as text, and everything else as chunks of R code
#' (with an optional header that sets chunk options).  This means that text and
#' chunk options are seen as comments by the R engine, but interpreted sensibly
#' by `spin()`: I'm getting the full power of `knitr` with the option to run
#' everything as a simple R script (without having to `tangle()` it first).
#' 
#' To combine this with the two other requirements above, I use a `Makefile` and
#' a helper script that calls `knitr::spin()` to create Markdown + LaTeX, 
#' `pandoc` to convert this to plain LaTeX, and then `latexmk` to create a PDF.
